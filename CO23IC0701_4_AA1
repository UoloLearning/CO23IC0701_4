        <h2>Holi</h2>
        <div class="para">
            Indians love celebrating Holi, also known as the "Festival of Colors".
            It is observed on the full moon day of the Hindu calendar's 'Phalgun' month and in March on the Gregorian calendar.
            People take part in the festival by painting their faces with both dry and wet colours.
            People also participate in the celebration by singing folk songs and dancing.
